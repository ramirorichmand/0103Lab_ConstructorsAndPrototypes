# Lab Exercise 01/03/23 - Constructors & Prototypes

In this exercise we explored some of the differences between how classes are defined in Java and JavaScript. Used a car dealership format and created the classes, including their properties and behaviours, using JavaScript.

Created project from scratch and installed dependencies (hint: `npm install -D jest`).

## Task

- Created ` Car` class. The car has properties representing manufacturer, price and engine type.
- Set up Jest and wrote tests to ensure accessibility to each of the properties in a `Car` object.
- Created a `Dealership` class. It contains properties representing its name, maximum number of cars it has and the cars currently in stock.
- Added methods to `Dealership` to:
  - Counted the number of cars in stock
  - Added a car to stock
  - Returned an array containing each car's manufacturer
  - Found all the cars from a given manufacturer
  - Found the total value of all the cars in stock
- Wrote tests for `Dealership`'s methods.
